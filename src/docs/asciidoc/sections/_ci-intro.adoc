=== Continous Integration


Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developer working
copies to a shared mainline several times a day.


=== Continous Delivery/Deployment


Continuous delivery (CD) is an approach in which teams produce software in short cycles,
ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time.

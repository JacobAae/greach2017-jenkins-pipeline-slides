== Pipeline Fundamentals


=== Why


* Easy to *build all branches*
* CI Pipeline as *code* (stored with project in repo)
* Pipelines can survive restarts of the Jenkins master.
* Can optionally stop and wait for human input or approval
* Ability to fork/join, loop, and perform work in parallel.
* supports custom extensions to its DSL


=== Why Not

* Other CI systems do this as well
* Syntax confusion
** Declarative Pipeline
** Scripted Pipeline

=== Why

TIP: It Groovy!


== Scripted Pipeline

[NOTE.speaker]
====
Will shortly touch on declarative later
====



=== Components

[source,groovy]
----
node { // <1>
    stage('Build') { // <2>
        sh './gradlew build' // <3>
    }
}
----

<1> *node* - allocate an executor and workspace for this part of the Pipeline.
<2> *stage* - a stage of this Pipeline.
<3> *step* using `sh` Execute shell command

=== Node


. Schedules the steps in the Jenkins queue
. Creates a workspace where work can be done on files checked out from source control.


=== Stage


Defining a conceptually distinct subset of the entire Pipeline

=== Stage

=== Step


A single task

Fundamentally steps tell Jenkins what to do.

More steps exposed by various plugins


== Declarative Pipeline

=== Components

[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {    // <1>
    agent any    // <2>
    stages {
        stage('Example') {     // <3>
            steps {     // <4>
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
    }
    post {     // <5>
        always {     // <6>
            echo 'I will always say Hello again!'
        }
    }
}
----

<3> stage
<4> step
<5> Post section
<6> Condition for executing

=== Declarative vs Scripted

*Scripted*

* Scripted is real Groovy (almost)
* Very flexible
* Imperative programming model

*Declarative*

* Simpler and more opinionated syntax
* Smaller learning curve (for non-Groovy programmers)

TIP: Fundamentally the same


[NOTE.speaker]
====
As they can be restarted, collection.each is not possible

= Jenkins pipeline

== Abstract

*Stuck on Jenkins or High on Pipeline?*

In this talk, I will take a critical look at the Jenkins Pipelines.

What is the status of the documentation, what are the nooks and crannies
to get things working, and what is a real PITA to get working.

In the process, the pipeline used for a development pipeline will be demoed, with code samples.

== Docker Jenkins

 docker exec jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword

TIP: It is not triviel to build and push docker images from a dockerized jenkins

There are docker-compose files for two different configurations of Jenkins,
that will store its configurations between restars in the docker folder
